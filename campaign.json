		{

		},
		{
			"version":"v1.1",
			"date":"2019-02-26",
			"notes":" * Interlude 1 - Haley, though still somewhat rude in general, no longer races ahead of Trench.\n * 3-0 - Turmalis and Khrillian now correctly withdraw from the battle, rather than obstinately standing and taking a beating.\n * 3-5 - Continuing in the theme of things not dying correctly, gas generators are may now be destroyed.\n * 3-7 - Ok, this is getting ridiculous, but the miners will now correctly destroy the rocks.\n"
